Aircraft Potential Risks Analysis

### Business Problem Statement

- My company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. 
- Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft.
- I am charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor.
- I must then translate my findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

### The Data

The dataset is from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.
I shall analyse and use the data to make actionable insights to aid in the aircraft purchase decision
